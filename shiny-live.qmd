## What is Shinylive?

**Shinylive** is a new way to run Shiny apps **directly in the browser** — without needing a server. It’s designed for teaching, demos, and small apps that don’t need to constantly communicate with a backend server.

Shinylive runs your Shiny app **completely in the user's browser** using a technology called WebAssembly. This means everything runs locally — nothing is sent back and forth to a server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How is Shinylive Different from Traditional Shiny?

| Feature | Traditional Shiny | Shinylive |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Runs on | A server (e.g., shinyapps.io) | Directly in the web browser |
| Requires server setup | Yes | No |
| Needs internet? | Usually, yes | No (if the page is saved locally) |
| Good for heavy data? | Yes | No — limited by browser resources |
| App responsiveness | Depends on server speed | Very fast, since it's local |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Shinylive

-   **No server needed**: You don’t need to deploy to shinyapps.io or set up a server.
-   **Easy to share**: You can publish it with Quarto to GitHub Pages or Quarto Pub.
-   **Faster loading**: Since it runs in the browser, there's no server delay.
-   **Great for teaching/demos**: Perfect for lightweight apps and simple data visualizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Shinylive

-   **Limited performance**: Can’t handle large datasets or complex back-end calculations.
-   **Browser-dependent**: Only works well in modern browsers.
-   **No long-term storage**: Can’t save user inputs or connect to databases.
-   **Security**: All your code is visible in the browser (since there’s no server).

## Summary

Shinylive is an exciting way to make simple Shiny apps more accessible. It’s ideal for educational purposes, small dashboards, and quick demos — especially when you don’t want to manage server hosting. However, for more complex applications with large data or secure back-end logic, traditional Shiny is still the way to go.
